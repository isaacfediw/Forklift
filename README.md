# Forklift
This project is a remote controlled electric forklift that I made with a partner for a 4 week course at BCIT  
  
## Electrical Hardware
The electrical hardware for this project consisted of a Rasberry Pi 4, a custom made pcb, two dc motor drivers, and two stepper motor drivers  
  
## Software
The mechanical design of the forklift was done in Fusion 360. The design files are included in this project in case you're interested  
The forklift was coded on the raspberry pi in c++ using CodeBlocks IDE
